Berlin Study Jam Session
========================

Lesson 1 and 2

This [Talk](./Lesson1&2.html) is a recap of the first two lessons of the
[udacity](http://www.udacity.com) curse [Developing Android Apps - 
Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853). It will 
cover a short repetition of the first lesson, essentially on how to 
setup your system for android developement, and an more advanced second
lesson about how to connect the sample project _Sunshine_ to the cloud.
