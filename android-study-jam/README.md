Berlin Study Jam Session
========================

Lesson 1 and 2
--------------

This [Talk](./Lesson1&2.html) is a recap of the first two lessons of the
[udacity](http://www.udacity.com) curse [Developing Android Apps - 
Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853). It will 
cover a short repetition of the first lesson, essentially on how to 
setup your system for android developement, and an more advanced second
lesson about how to connect the sample project _Sunshine_ to the cloud.

The talk is designed using [strut.io](http://strut.io/editor/index.html) 
and modified by hand. If you want to see the differences, feel free to
use [the exported json file](./Lesson1&3.json) in the editor. 

Alternatively feel free to examine the git repository history ...


Lesson 3
--------

The third talk of the same course, covering intents and activities. the
organisation is the same ad before: *strut.io*, but this time local, 
since the server did not seem to react.
